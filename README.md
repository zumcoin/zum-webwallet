# ZumCoin Web Wallet is a fork of the Masari Web Wallet - Fully client-side 
This web wallet is doing everything client-side to give the best privacy to users.
The server is currently only used to optimize the communication with the daemon and compress the blockchain.  

Note: This requirement may be removed in the future once daemons evolve and return enough data.  

# Security
**No keys, seeds, or sensitive data is sent to the server**  
If you find a potential security issue, please contact me so we/I can patch it as soon as possible.  
Encryption is done with a certified library, [Tweetnacl.Js.](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js)

# Forks / Other Coins
We have been receiving multiple coin developers help to fork it. As the time required to develop this project is heavy, please consider giving a mention to this project if you fork it.

If you are a developer of a Cryptonote/Monero fork and would like to get a fork, please contact us (@gnock on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/eSb9ZdM)).

Depending on your coin specifics, I can provide support, maintenancem and development/updates for a payment in return - crypto only.
If you are not willing to pay for this service, please do not contact us and make us lose time.

The code is readable, it should be enough for you to use it.
